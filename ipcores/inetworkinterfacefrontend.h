 * \brief The INetworkInterfaceFrontEnd class is an Interface for a FrontEnd (Shell) module which works as a connection
 * bridge between a custom Processor Element (IP-Core) and a NetworkInteface module of the Network on Chip.
 *
 * Note: It's expected from a classe that implements this class to have four basic events to handle the communication
 * between the front-end and the back-end. This event are:
 *      * valid       - Used to signal that the back-end has write to the front-end.
 *      * ack         - Used to signal that the back-end has read from the front-end.
 *      * writing     - Used to signal that the front-end is writing to the back-end.
 *      * reading     - Used to signal that the front-end is reading from the back-end.
